# Research-on-ERBB2-gene-editing-using-CRISPR-Cas9
This repository contains research on the ERBB2 (HER2) gene and its role in cancer, using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to explore mutations and their impact on tumorigenesis. The project aims to identify new therapeutic targets and insights into HER2-related cancer therapies and resistance mechanisms.
